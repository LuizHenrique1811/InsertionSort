<h1>InsertSort</h1>
<p>
    &nbsp; The InsertSort algorithm works by dividing the input array into a sorted and an unsorted region. It iterates through the unsorted region, extracting one element and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted region.
</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It's simple and efficient for small arrays or nearly sorted arrays</li>
    <li>It's stable - maintains the relative order of equal elements</li>
    <li>It has a low space complexity of O(1)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantage</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It's not suitable for large arrays</li>
    <li>It's less efficient compared to advanced algorithms like QuickSort and MergeSort for large datasets</li>
</ul>
<h3>Comparsion Execution Time</h3>
<p>
    &nbsp; The InsertSort algorithm has a time complexity of O(nÂ²) in the average and worst cases however, if the array is already sorted, Its time complexity is O(n).
